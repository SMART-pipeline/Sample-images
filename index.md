## SMART Image Browser

[SMART](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.313395v1) stands for “**S**erial sectioning and clearing, 3-dimensional **M**icroscopy, with semi-**A**utomated **R**econstruction and **T**racing”. It is an integrative technologies for high-throughput imaging and analysis that combines primate-optimized tissue sectioning and clearing with ultrahigh-speed, large-scale, volumetric fluorescence microscopy, capable of completing whole-brain imaging of a rhesus monkey at 1 µm × 1 µm × 2.5 µm voxel resolution within 100 hours.

The full dataset of a macaque brain is ~250 TB 16-bit TIFF images. Below are sample images of several slices.

## Sample 2D projections
### Imageset 1
This monkey was injected with AAV-eGFP and AAV-mCherry into bilateral superior collicuclus (SC). A third channel is for DAPI staining.

A sample image could be viewed in the SMART Image Browser:

### Imageset 2
This monkey was injected with AAV-eGFP and AAV-mCherry into bilateral mediodorsal nucleus of thalumus (MD).

### Imageset 3
This monkey brain slice is stained with anti-TH antibody for labeling dopaminergic projections.

## Sample 3D image blocks
### Imageset 4
[Lychnis tracer] is for 3D fiber tracing in raw image spaces.

Here is a series of image blocks that are surrounding a thalamocortical axon.
